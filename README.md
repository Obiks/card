## My process
Started with positioning my html file in order to know how my styling would look like.
Tried as much as possible to reduce my styling code, though at the end it became more... (to work on it on my next project)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learnt how to set up media queries for both mobile and desktop view


### Continued development

My major continued development is to complete a website without the help of a framework, and I am really working towards that.


### Useful resources

- [CSS FOR PROFESSIONALS](ebook) - This is my major ebook when it comes to css styling. You can check it out.

- [W3SCHOOLS]](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - i was able to do some media query after reading the content on the website
